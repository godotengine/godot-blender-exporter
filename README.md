# Godot Engine's native Blender exporter add-on.

Native Godot scene format exporter for [Blender](https://www.blender.org), making the
export process to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) as straightforward as possible.

*WARNING*: This exporter is experimental, and still lacks many features.

## Installation

1. Copy the `io_scene_godot` directory the location where Blender stores the
   scripts/addons folder on your system (you should see other io_scene_*
   folders there from other addons). Copy the entire dir and not just its
   contents.
2. Go to the Blender settings and enable the "Godot Exporter" plugin.
3. Export your file with `File` -> `Export` -> `Godot Engine (.escn)`

If you find bugs or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue on the
upstream [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/blender-exporter).

## Development Notes

This repository includes a Makefile to assist with development. Running
`make` from the project root will:

1. Export all of the blend files from the `tests/scenes` directory.  
   If you add a feature, it is suggested that you add a new blend file to 
   the `tests/scenes` directory that uses this feature.
2. Runs `diff` on the output files conpared to the reference exports. This acts
   as a regression test.
3. Runs [pycodestyle](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and
   [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) style tests. Your code must pass these to
   be elegible to merge.


Due to differences in blender versions creating minor differences in the 
output files (even with the same blender release number), the regression tests 
are best run with blender 2.79 downloaded from 
[this exact url](http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/blender.org/release/Blender2.79/), 
which is used for the Travis builds. If you think your blender version is 
adequate, the hash (visble in the upper right of blender's splash screen) 
should be `5bd8ac9abfa`. The exporter itself should run on all modern versions 
of blender, but the output may differ slightly.
